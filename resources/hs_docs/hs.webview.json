{"datastore":{"type":"Module","doc":"Provides methods to list and purge the various types of data used by websites visited with `hs.webview`.\n\nThis module is only available under OS X 10.11 and later.\n\nThis module allows you to list and selectively purge the types of data stored locally for the websites visited with the `hs.webview` module.  It also adds support for non-persistent datastores to `hs.webview` (private browsing) and allows a non-persistent datastore to be shared among multiple instances of `hs.webview` objects.\n\nThe datastore for a webview contains various types of data including cookies, disk and memory caches, and persistent data such as WebSQL, IndexedDB databases, and local storage.  You can use methods in this module to selectively or completely purge the common datastore (used by all Hammerspoon `hs.webview` instances that do not use a non-persistent datastore).","def":"-> hs.webview.datastore"},"toolbar":{"type":"Module","doc":"Create and manipulate toolbars which can be attached to the Hammerspoon console or hs.webview objects.\n\nToolbars are attached to titled windows and provide buttons which can be used to perform various actions within the application. Hammerspoon can use this module to add toolbars to the console or `hs.webview` objects which have a title bar (see `hs.webview.windowMasks` and `hs.webview:windowStyle`). Toolbars are identified by a unique identifier which is used by OS X to identify information which can be auto saved in the application's user defaults to reflect changes the user has made to the toolbar button order or active button list (this requires setting [hs.webview.toolbar:autosaves](#autosaves) and [hs.webview.toolbar:canCustomize](#canCustomize) both to true).\n\nMultiple copies of the same toolbar can be made with the [hs.webview.toolbar:copy](#copy) method so that multiple webview windows use the same toolbar, for example. If the user customizes a copied toolbar, changes to the active buttons or their order will be reflected in all copies of the toolbar.\n\nExample:\n~~~lua\nt = require(\"hs.webview.toolbar\")\na = t.new(\"myConsole\", {\n        { id = \"select1\", selectable = true, image = hs.image.imageFromName(\"NSStatusAvailable\") },\n        { id = \"NSToolbarSpaceItem\" },\n        { id = \"select2\", selectable = true, image = hs.image.imageFromName(\"NSStatusUnavailable\") },\n        { id = \"notShown\", default = false, image = hs.image.imageFromName(\"NSBonjour\") },\n        { id = \"NSToolbarFlexibleSpaceItem\" },\n        { id = \"navGroup\", label = \"Navigation\", groupMembers = { \"navLeft\", \"navRight\" }},\n        { id = \"navLeft\", image = hs.image.imageFromName(\"NSGoLeftTemplate\"), allowedAlone = false },\n        { id = \"navRight\", image = hs.image.imageFromName(\"NSGoRightTemplate\"), allowedAlone = false },\n        { id = \"NSToolbarFlexibleSpaceItem\" },\n        { id = \"cust\", label = \"customize\", fn = function(t, w, i) t:customizePanel() end, image = hs.image.imageFromName(\"NSAdvanced\") }\n    }):canCustomize(true)\n      :autosaves(true)\n      :selectedItem(\"select2\")\n      :setCallback(function(...)\n                        print(\"a\", inspect(table.pack(...)))\n                   end)\n\nt.attachToolbar(a)\n~~~\n\nNotes:\n * This module is supported in OS X versions prior to 10.10 (for the Hammerspoon console only), even though its parent `hs.webview` is not.
