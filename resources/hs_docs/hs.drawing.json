{"color":{"type":"Module","doc":"Provides access to the system color lists and a wider variety of ways to represent color within Hammerspoon.\n\nColor is represented within Hammerspoon as a table containing keys which tell Hammerspoon how the color is specified.  You can specify a color in one of the following ways, depending upon the keys you supply within the table:\n\n* As a combination of Red, Green, and Blue elements (RGB Color):\n  * red   - the red component of the color specified as a number from 0.0 to 1.0.\n  * green - the green component of the color specified as a number from 0.0 to 1.0.\n  * blue  - the blue component of the color specified as a number from 0.0 to 1.0.\n  * alpha - the color transparency from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (completely opaque)\n\n* As a combination of Hue, Saturation, and Brightness (HSB or HSV Color):\n  * hue        - the hue component of the color specified as a number from 0.0 to 1.0.\n  * saturation - the saturation component of the color specified as a number from 0.0 to 1.0.\n  * brightness - the brightness component of the color specified as a number from 0.0 to 1.0.\n  * alpha      - the color transparency from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (completely opaque)\n\n* As grayscale (Grayscale Color):\n  * white - the ratio of white to black from 0.0 (completely black) to 1.0 (completely white)\n  * alpha - the color transparency from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (completely opaque)\n\n* From the system or Hammerspoon color lists:\n  * list - the name of a system color list or a collection list defined in `hs.drawing.color`\n  * name - the color name within the specified color list\n\n* As an HTML style hex color specification:\n  * hex   - a string of the format \"#rrggbb\" or \"#rgb\" where `r`, `g`, and `b` are hexadecimal digits (i.e. 0-9, A-F)\n  * alpha - the color transparency from 0.0 (completely transparent) to 1.0 (completely opaque)\n\n* From an image to be used as a tiled pattern:\n  * image - an `hs.image` object representing the image to be used as a tiled pattern\n\nAny combination of the above keys may be specified within the color table and they will be evaluated in the following order:\n  1. if the `image` key is specified, it will be used to create a tiling pattern.\n  2. If the `list` and `name` keys are specified, and if they can be matched to an existing color within the system color lists, that color is used.\n  3. If the `hue` key is provided, then the color is generated as an HSB color\n  4. If the `white` key is provided, then the color is generated as a Grayscale color\n  5. Otherwise, an RGB color is generated.\n\nExcept where specified above to indicate the color model being used, any key which is not provided defaults to a value of 0.0, except for `alpha`, which defaults to 1.0.
