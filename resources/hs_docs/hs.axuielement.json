{"axtextmarker":{"type":"Module","doc":"This submodule allows hs.axuielement to support using AXTextMarker and AXTextMarkerRange objects as parameters for parameterized Accessibility attributes with applications that support them.\n\nMost Accessibility object values correspond to the common data types found in most programming languages -- strings, numbers, tables (arrays and dictionaries), etc. AXTextMarker and AXTextMarkerRange types are application specific and do not have a direct mapping to a simple data type. The description I've found most apt comes from comments within the Chromium source for the Mac version of their browser:\n\n> // A serialization of a position as POD. Not for sharing on disk or sharing\n> // across thread or process boundaries, just for passing a position to an\n> // API that works with positions as opaque objects.\n\nThis submodule allows Lua to represent these as userdata which can be passed in to parameterized attributes for the application from which they were retrieved. Examples are expected to be added to the Hammerspoon wiki soon.\n\nAs this submodule utilizes private and undocumented functions in the HIServices framework, if you receive an error using any of these functions or methods indicating an undefined CF function (the function or method will return nil and a string of the format \"CF function AX... undefined\"), please make sure to include the output of the following in any issue you submit to the Hammerspoon github page (enter these into the Hammerspoon console):\n\n    hs.inspect(hs.axuielement.axtextmarker._functionCheck())\n    hs.inspect(hs.processInfo)\n    hs.host.operatingSystemVersionString()","def":"-> hs.axuielement.axtextmarker"},"observer":{"type":"Module","doc":"This submodule allows you to create observers for accessibility elements and be notified when they trigger notifications.

The callback should expect three arguments and return none. The arguments to the callback function will be `msg`, a string specifying how the search ended and `results`, the elementSearchObject containing the requested results, and the number of items added to the results (see `count` in `namedModifiers`). `msg` will be \"completed\" if the search completes normally, or a string starting with \"**\" if it is terminated early (see Returns: and Notes: for more details).\n * `criteria`       - an optional function which should accept one argument (the current element being examined) and return true if it should be included in the results or false if it should be rejected. See [hs.axuielement.searchCriteriaFunction](#searchCriteriaFunction) to create a search function that uses [hs.axuielement:matchesCriteria](#matchesCriteria) for evaluation.\n * `namedModifiers` - an optional table specifying key-value pairs that further modify or control the search. This table may contain 0 or more of the following keys:\n   * `count`          - an optional integer, default `math.huge`, specifying the maximum number of matches to collect before ending the search and invoking the callback. You can continue the search to find additional elements by invoking `elementSearchObject:next()` (described below in the `Returns` section) on the return value of this method, or on the results argument passed to the callback.\n   * `depth`          - an optional integer, default `math.huge`, specifying the maximum number of steps (descendants) from the initial accessibility element the search should visit. If you know that your desired element(s) are relatively close to your starting element, setting this to a lower value can significantly speed up the search.\n   * The following are also recognized, but may impact the speed of the search, the responsiveness of Hammerspoon, or the format of the results in ways that limit further filtering and are not recommended except when you know that you require them:\n     * `asTree`         - an optional boolean, default false, and ignored if `criteria` is specified and non-empty, `objectOnly` is true, or `count` is specified. This modifier specifies whether the search results should return as an array table of tables containing each element's details (false) or as a tree where in which the root node details are the key-value pairs of the returned table and descendant elements are likewise described in subtables attached to the attribute name they belong to (true). This format is primarily for debugging and exploratory purposes and may not be arranged for easy programatic evaluation.\n     * `includeParents` - a boolean, default false, specifying whether or not parent attributes (`AXParent` and `AXTopLevelUIElement`) should be examined during the search. Note that in most cases, setting this value to true will end up traversing the entire Accessibility structure for the target application and may significantly slow down the search.\n     * `noCallback`     - an optional boolean, default false, and ignored if `callback` is not also nil, allowing you to specify nil as the callback when set to true. This feature requires setting this named argument to true *and* specifying the callback field as nil because starting a query from an element with a lot of descendants **WILL** block Hammerspoon and slow down the responsiveness of your computer (I've seen blocking for over 5 minutes in extreme cases) and should be used *only* when you know you are starting from close to the end of the element hierarchy.\n     * `objectOnly`     - an optional boolean, default true, specifying whether each result in the final table will be the accessibility element discovered (true) or a table containing details about the element include the attribute names, actions, etc. for the element (false). This latter format is primarily for debugging and exploratory purposes and may not be arranged for easy programatic evaluation.\n\nReturns:\n * an elementSearchObject which contains metamethods allowing you to check to see if the process has completed and cancel it early if desired. The methods include:\n   * `elementSearchObject:cancel([reason])` - cancels the current search and invokes the callback with the partial results already collected. If you specify `reason`, the `msg` argument for the callback will be `** <reason>`; otherwise it will be \"** cancelled\".\n   * `elementSearchObject:isRunning()`      - returns true if the search is currently ongoing or false if it has completed or been cancelled.\n   * `elementSearchObject:matched()`        - returns an integer specifying the number of elements which have already been found that meet the specified criteria function.\n   * `elementSearchObject:runTime()`        - returns an integer specifying the number of seconds spent performing this search. Note that this is *not* an accurate measure of how much time a given search will always take because the time will be greatly affected by how much other activity is occurring within Hammerspoon and on the users computer. Resuming a cancelled search or a search which invoked the callback because it reached `count` items with the `next` method (described below) will cause this number to begin increasing again to provide a cumulative total of time spent performing the search; time between when the callback is invoked and the `next` method is invoked is not included.\n   * `elementSearchObject:visited()`        - returns an integer specifying the number of elements which have been examined during the search so far.\n   * If `asTree` is false or not specified, the following additional methods will be available:\n     * `elementSearchObject:filter(criteria, [callback]) -> filterObject`\n       * returns a new table containing elements in the search results that match the specified criteria.\n         * `criteria`  - a required function which should accept one argument (the current element being examined) and return true if it should be included in the results or false if it should be rejected.
