{"echoRequest":{"type":"Module","doc":"Provides lower-level access to the ICMP Echo Request infrastructure used by the hs.network.ping module. In general, you should not need to use this module directly unless you have specific requirements not met by the hs.network.ping module and the `hs.network.ping` object methods.\n\nThis module is based heavily on Apple's SimplePing sample project which can be found at https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/SimplePing/Introduction/Intro.html.\n\nWhen a callback function argument is specified as an ICMP table, the Lua table returned will contain the following key-value pairs:\n * `checksum`       - The ICMP packet checksum used to ensure data integrity.\n * `code`           - ICMP Control Message Code. This should always be 0 unless the callback has received a \"receivedUnexpectedPacket\" message.\n * `identifier`     - The ICMP packet identifier.  This should match the results of [hs.network.ping.echoRequest:identifier](#identifier) unless the callback has received a \"receivedUnexpectedPacket\" message.\n * `payload`        - A string containing the ICMP payload for this packet. The default payload has been constructed to cause the ICMP packet to be exactly 64 bytes to match the convention for ICMP Echo Requests.\n * `sequenceNumber` - The ICMP Sequence Number for this packet.\n * `type`           - ICMP Control Message Type. Unless the callback has received a \"receivedUnexpectedPacket\" message, this will be 0 (ICMPv4) or 129 (ICMPv6) for packets we receive and 8 (ICMPv4) or 128 (ICMPv6) for packets we send.\n * `_raw`           - A string containing the ICMP packet as raw data.\n\nIn cases where the callback receives a \"receivedUnexpectedPacket\" message because the packet is corrupted or truncated, this table may only contain the `_raw` field.","def":"-> hs.network.ping.echoRequest"},"address":{"def":"hs.network.ping:address() -> string","desc":"Returns a string containing the resolved IPv4 or IPv6 address this pingObject is sending echo requests to.","doc":"Returns a string containing the resolved IPv4 or IPv6 address this pingObject is sending echo requests to.\n\nParameters:\n * None\n\nReturns:\n * A string containing the IPv4 or IPv6 address this pingObject is sending echo requests to or \"<unresolved address>\" if the address cannot be resolved.","examples":[],"file":"extensions/network/ping/network_ping.lua","lineno":"186","name":"address","notes":[],"parameters":[" * None"],"returns":[" * A string containing the IPv4 or IPv6 address this pingObject is sending echo requests to or \"<unresolved address>\" if the address cannot be resolved."],"signature":"hs.network.ping:address() -> string","stripped_doc":"","type":"Method"},"cancel":{"def":"hs.network.ping:cancel() -> none","desc":"Cancels an in progress ping process, terminating it immediately","doc":"Cancels an in progress ping process, terminating it immediately\n\nParameters:\n * None\n\nReturns:\n * None\n\nNotes:\n * the `didFinish` message will be sent to the callback function as its final message.","examples":[],"file":"extensions/network/ping/network_ping.lua","lineno":"251","name":"cancel","notes":[" * the `didFinish` message will be sent to the callback function as its final message."],"parameters":[" * None"],"returns":[" * None"],"signature":"hs.network.ping:cancel() -> none","stripped_doc":"","type":"Method"},"count":{"def":"hs.network.ping:count([count]) -> integer | pingObject | nil","desc":"Get or set the number of ICMP Echo Requests that will be sent by the ping process","doc":"Get or set the number of ICMP Echo Requests that will be sent by the ping process\n\nParameters:\n * `count` - an optional integer specifying the total number of echo requests that the ping process should send.
