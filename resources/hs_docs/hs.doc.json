Still experimental.\n\nThis submodule provides functions for mimicking the documentation generation processes used when generating the official Hammerspoon documentation.  The long term goal is to provide a mechanism for generating complete Hammerspoon documentation in all of its formats with only the Hammerspoon application and source files without any additional software required.\n\nThis submodule can be used to generate and maintain the documentation for Spoon bundles and can also be used to generate documentation for third-party modules as well.\n\nDocumentation for modules and spoons is expected to be embedded in the source code for the relevant object in specially formatted comment strings.  A very brief example of how to format documentation can be found at https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/blob/master/SPOONS.md#documentation, but a better treatment is planned.\n\nMost of this submodule should be considered at the \"Proof of Concept\" stage and will require some additional work on your part to generate useful documentation in HTML, Markdown, or Docset formats.  This is expected to change in the future.","def":"-> hs.doc.builder"},"hsdocs":{"type":"Module","doc":"Manage the internal documentation web server.\n\nThis module provides functions for managing the Hammerspoon built-in documentation web server.
