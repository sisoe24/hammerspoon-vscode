{"lp":{"type":"Module","doc":"Support functions for the CGILua compatibility module for including and translating Lua template pages into Lua code for execution within the Hammerspoon environment to provide dynamic content for http requests.\n\nThe most commonly used function is likely to be [cgilua.lp.include](#include), which allows including a template driven file during rendering so that common code can be reused more easily.  While passing in your own environment table for upvalues is possible, this is not recommended for general use because the default environment passed to each included file ensures that all server variables and the CGILua compatibility functions are available with the same names, and any new non-local (i.e. \"global\") variable defined are shared with the calling environment and not shared with the Hammerspoon global environment.\n\nIf your template file requires the ability to create variables in the Hammerspoon global environment, access the global environment directly through `_G`.\n\nNote that the above considerations only apply to creating new \"global\" variables.  Any currently defined global variables (for example, the `hs` table where Hammerspoon module functions are stored) are available within the template file as long as no local or CGILua environment variable shares the same name (e.g. `_G[\"hs\"]` and `hs` refer to the same table.\n\nSee the documentation for the [cgilua.lp.include](#include) for more information.","def":"-> hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.lp"},"urlcode":{"type":"Module","doc":"Support functions for the CGILua compatibility module for encoding and decoding URL components in accordance with RFC 3986.","def":"-> hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.urlcode"},"contentheader":{"def":"hs.httpserver.hsminweb.cgilua.contentheader(maintype, subtype) -> none","desc":"Sets the HTTP response type for the content being generated to maintype/subtype.","doc":"Sets the HTTP response type for the content being generated to maintype/subtype.\n\nParameters:\n * maintype - the primary content type (e.g. \"text\")\n * subtype  - the sub-type for the content (e.g. \"plain\")\n\nReturns:\n * None\n\nNotes:\n * This sets the `Content-Type` header field for the HTTP response being generated.
